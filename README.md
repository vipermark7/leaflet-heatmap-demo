# leaflet-heatmap-demo

This repo is intended to be a showcase of some cool plugins Leaflet has, like heatmap and markercluster. Leaflet is a tool that displays helpful visualizations on top of basemaps provided by OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, and other providers. 


# heatmap 

The heatmap essentially takes a bumch of points and displays a colored map over them that gets darker the more concentrated the points of interest are. This is good for getting a feel of data and illustrating where something is occuring the most often, like bike thefts or tracking property prices in an area. 

# markercluster 

The markercluster is a great option when you want to illustrate your data as a whole bunch of seperate points, but drawing them all seperately would be bad for readability and performance. The more you zoom in, the more seperate clusters you can see in an area!
